on initial test drive to warm up for service vehicle stumbled several times and had an $T$ failure after this initial test drive i was never able to duplicate the concern again though there were several faults present in different control modules for overvoltage  not wanting to deliver the customer in a state in which it would fail on them as it did on me i attempted driving multiple times with test equipment to duplicate the concern and catch it in the act but the symptom never reoccurred though the abspsm failures came on the instrument cluster and there were corresponding faults recorded by these and other control modules  i ran several tests on the electrical system charging system and battery and all passed at this time there is a possibility that this is just a oneoff issue but it may also be the beginning manifestation of a failing part with regard to this the battery life is currently registering around  with the original battery but is not showing any other signs of failure and passes all tests at this time however failing batteries can cause odd and intermittent electrical problems  in the end i was unable to duplicate the concern again and the vehicle drove fine over several test drives totaling  miles  this fault led to the finding and repairing of the fault on line m for the lane change system
