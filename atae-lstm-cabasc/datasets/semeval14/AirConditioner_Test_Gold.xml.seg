customer states chassis system failure message is on inspected vehicle verified customer concern also observed that front end of vehicle sits substantially lower than the rear when attempting to actuate level adjustment there is no function tested vehicle for stored fault codes along with running and uploading val found   level control position not reached and   control position not adjustable vehicle too high or too low when attempting to actuate air compressor compressor does not function attempted to apply direct voltage to connector of compressor and found that when voltage is applied compressor twitches but does not run indicating seized up compressor due to mechanical failure of $T$ valve block also needs to be replaced to eliminate the possibility of debris preventing proper function of system after identifying failure isolated each corner using special tool  adapters inflated each corner and allowed vehicle to sit over night the next morning found that right front corner was psi lower than the rest of the vehicles inspected air line for rf air spring and found no leaks concluded leak in air strut assembly and replaced air strut installed new compressorvalve block relay and fuse for compressor and filled system with compressed nitrogen performed height sensor calibration and confirmed proper function of system upon completion returned vehicle to customer

tested ac blower blower slowed in speed and made whirling noise after about  mins of testing removed blower and bench tested blower getting  volts as it should once blower started slowing down watched the pwm signal only sit at  volts and not go any higher at this point i recommend new blower motor resistor pack however due to motor slowing down when heat started to build up in motor it may need $T$ as well recommend starting with known part failure of resistor first then retest
