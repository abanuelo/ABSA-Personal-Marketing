appears the ignition lock is not functioning correctly when key is stuck the dash warning for transmission not in park is displayed i checked the shifter position switch it read correctly i noticed that if the key is put in off position aggressively the key removes every time i tried a new ignition switch this did not work i disassemble shifter found that the micro switch for the shifter in park position does not always read tried the new micro switch this did not fix the problem now there is a present fault stored for terminal  power short to ground after checking the fuse right fuse box f witch is good there is no power to the transmission control unit there is a open circuit in the wire harness removed the passenger seat and carpet unrapped the main wire harness to find the splice sais found the splice there is a lot of corrosion at the splice i cut back the wire crimped the connections and $T$ shrink the connections i repaired all the spliced connection at that area of the harness  in total reinstalled the carpet and seat cleared all the stored faults the ignition key switch is working correctly test drove  all the vehicle functions are working

on initial test drive to warm up for service vehicle stumbled several times and had an $T$ failure after this initial test drive i was never able to duplicate the concern again though there were several faults present in different control modules for overvoltage  not wanting to deliver the customer in a state in which it would fail on them as it did on me i attempted driving multiple times with test equipment to duplicate the concern and catch it in the act but the symptom never reoccurred though the abspsm failures came on the instrument cluster and there were corresponding faults recorded by these and other control modules  i ran several tests on the electrical system charging system and battery and all passed at this time there is a possibility that this is just a oneoff issue but it may also be the beginning manifestation of a failing part with regard to this the battery life is currently registering around  with the original battery but is not showing any other signs of failure and passes all tests at this time however failing batteries can cause odd and intermittent electrical problems  in the end i was unable to duplicate the concern again and the vehicle drove fine over several test drives totaling  miles  this fault led to the finding and repairing of the fault on line m for the lane change system
